    <a id="crime_spree" class="anchor" href="#crime_spree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Crime Spree</h4>

<p>Jessica was the lead programmer on Crime Spree. It is an iOS game with a Rally X and PacMan style gameplay. The key features of the game include:<br /><br />- Arcade Mode – Avoid the police and collect all the loot to progress to the next level<br />- Survival Mode – Collect as much cash as you can before getting caught by the police<br />- Three Control Options - Either tilt, tap or swip to steer the car<br />- Local High Score Boards<br />- Global High Score Boards – Compete against players around the world<br /><br />

   The biggest challenge in programming Crime Spree was designing the algorithm that randomized the construction of each level. Programming the AI of the enemy police cars was the most satisfying.</p>

<p>Relaxation Portal is a relaxation and white noise style app for both iOS and Android. Jessica was the main programmer for both platforms. The key features include:<br /><br />- Fully Customizable Sound – Turn off any sounds you don't want to hear<br />- Beautiful Images – Explore the world through amazinzg pictures of each location<br />- Night Mode - Listen to the sounds without the brightness of the screen<br />- 3D effects - Plug in headphoes to feel immersed in the location<br /><br />

<p>Jessica was the lead programmer on Neopets Codestone Quest. Built upon MumboJumbo's Luxor engine, Jessica added many features to give the game a Neopets theme. A few of the visual effects that were fun to add were suspending the shooter on a rope, the path glow, and the page turns of the storybook.<br /><br />You can see more screenshots and a walkthrough of the game <a href="http://thedailyneopets.com/articles/codestone-quest/">here</a>.</p>
